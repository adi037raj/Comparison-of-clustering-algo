I have all my programs in python.
I have used the @profile to monitor the memory usage by the algorithm. But due to @profile , its taking longer time to calculate the result.
All the outputs in the report are the total time taken(including @profiling).
Sometimes it may take longer time to calculate the results.

For PCA:
	To change the reduced dimension value - line 56

For Apriori:
	I am taking the input file name and minimum support(Input file name should be with the extension)

For Eclat Algorithm:
	I am taking the input file name and minimum support(Input file name should be with the extension)

For FP tree:
	I am taking the input file name and minimum support(Input file name should be with the extension)
